# tango-icon-library-pngs

The Tango Icon Library as rasterized PNGs.

This repository copies 213 SVG icons from out of
http://tango.freedesktop.org/releases/tango-icon-theme-0.8.90.tar.gz
(flattening the directory naming scheme) and additionally provides PNG editions
of that suite, such as at 64x64 and 512x512 resolution.

See [Tango Icon Library](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library) for
the original project, whose development stopped in 2009.
